\usage{
examine.outliers(x, outliers = 10)

examine.changepoints(
  x,
  moment = c("mean", "variance"),
  method = c("PELT", "AMOC", "BinSeg"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{result.goldfish} output from an
\code{\link{estimate}} call.}

\item{outliers}{the number of outliers to report}

\item{moment}{character argument to choose between "mean" or "variance".
See section \emph{Change point} for details.}

\item{method}{Choice of \code{"AMOC"}, \code{"PELT"} or \code{"BinSeg"}.
For a detail description see \code{\link[changepoint]{cpt.mean}} or
\code{\link[changepoint]{cpt.var}}. The default value is \code{"PELT"}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the functions in the
\code{\link{changepoint}} package.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL} if neither outliers nor change points are identified.
A subset of the dependent event data frame
(see \code{\link{defineDependentEvents}}) with the events identified as
outliers or change point inflections.
}
\description{
Provide diagnostic functions for an object of class \code{result.goldfish}.
\code{outliers} helps to identify outliers events.
\code{changepoints} helps to identify where a change point
in the events sequence is presented using the log-likelihood.
}
\section{Outliers}{

\code{examine.outliers} creates a plot with the log-likelihood of the events
in the y-axis and the event index in the x-axis, identifying observations
not well-fitted by the model with a small red circle,
and prints a table of the top `outliers` events.
}

\section{Change point}{

The parameter \code{moment} controls which method from the package
\code{\link{changepoint}} is used:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"mean"}}{It uses the \code{\link[changepoint]{cpt.mean}}
  function to investigate optimal positioning and (potentially) number
  of change points for the log-likelihood of the events in mean.}
  \item{\code{"variance"}}{It uses the
  \code{\link[changepoint]{cpt.var}}
  function to investigate optimal positioning and (potentially) number
  of change points for the log-likelihood of the events in variance}
}
The function call creates a plot with the log-likelihood of the events
in the y-axis and the event index in the x-axis, highlighting the change
point sections identified by the method.
Also it prints a table of the change points events that are returned by the
method.
