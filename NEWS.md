# goldfish 1.5.0

## New features

* New DyNAM-i model available to model face-to-face interaction data, collected through video or RFID badges.
* Functions to transform interaction data into DyNAM-compatible objects

  ```R
  defineGroups_interaction(interactions_data, actors, seed.randomization)
  ```
* Estimation functions for the joining and leaving rates of a DyNAM-i model

  ```R
  estimate(
    dependent.events_interactions ~  1 + intercept(network_interactions, joining = 1) +
                                  ego(actors$age,joining = 1, subType = "centered") +
                                 ego(actors$age,joining = -1, subType = "centered"),
    model = "DyNAMi", subModel = "rate")
  ```
  
* Estimation functions for the choice part of a DyNAM-i model

  ```R
  estimate(
    dependent.events_interactions ~ diff(actors$age,subType="averaged_sum") ,
    model = "DyNAMi", subModel = "choice", 
    estimationInit = list(opportunitiesList = opportunities))
  ```
* New closure effects for `model = "DyNAM"` with `subModel = "choice"` and `model = "REM"`.
  Documentation is updated accordingly. 
  
  ```R
  cycle(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  clSender(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  clReceiver(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  mixedCycle(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  mixedClSender(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  mixedClReceiver(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  ```
  
## Minor improvements and fixes

* Minor bugs in parsing and printing solved.
* Solves some warnings regarding S3 generic/method consistency.
* Solves no visible binding for global variables.
* Documentation improvements creating new documentation pages
  aggregating similar functions on `print-method` and `update-method`.

## Breaking changes

* `tertius_diff()` and `node_trans()` are changed to `tertiusDiff()` and 
  `nodeTrans()` complaining with naming convention.

# goldfish 1.4.3

## New features

* `mixedTrans()` effect is created. It requires the definition of two networks
  to compute the number of two paths between nodes.

  ```R
  mixedTrans(list(bilatnet, contignet))
  ```

## Minor improvements and fixes

* `estimate()` no longer give warnings in R 4.0.0.
* Classes and types checkings are revisited and extended.
* `linkEvents()` is refactored as a S3 method.
* New `print` or `summary` methods for `goldfish` objects are developed.
* `head()` and `tail()` methods for `nodes.goldfish`, `network.goldfish`
  and `dependent.goldfish` are available.

# goldfish 1.3.2

## New features

* `tertius()` and `tertius_diff()` effects are created. It requires the
  definition of a network and an attribute.

  ```R
  tertius_diff(bilatnet, states$gdp)
  tertius(bilatnet, states$gdp)
  ```

# golfish 1.3.1

## New features

* `estimate()` now estimation routine in `C` for `model = "DyNAM"` and
  `subModel = "choice_coordination"`.

# goldfish 1.3.0 

## New features

* `estimate()` parameter `engine` through `estimationInit` argument control the estimation
  routine used.
  
  ```R
  mod01 <- estimate(callsDependent ~ inertia + recip + trans,
                    model = "DyNAM", subModel = "choice",
                    estimationInit = list(engine = "gather_compute"))
  ```
  
* `estimate()` now estimation routine in `C` except for `model = "DyNAM"` and
  `subModel = "choice_coordination"`.
* New effects definition for `model = "DyNAM"` and `subModel = "rate"`.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* `inertia` fixed bug when `weighted = TRUE`.

## Breaking changes

* `modelType` argument in `estimate()` have been deprecated in favour of `model` 
   and `submodel`.
   
## Internal changes

* New implementation of effects to improve preprocessing time in the initialization
  of the statistical matrices and the reintroduction of a cache object for complex 
  structural network effects.

## Minor improvements and fixes

* Added more examples for `estimate()`.
* Extend documentation of `defineDependentEvents()`, `defineGlobalAttribute()`, 
  `defineNetwork()`, `defineNodes()` and `linkEvents()`.

# goldfish 1.2.1 

* Introduce a new efficient estimation routine.
